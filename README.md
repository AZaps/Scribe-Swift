#Scribe iOS App in Swift
Currently in development app built for iOS devices in Swift.

I am hosting this project on Github as a way for others to learn and also for myself to improve my own coding capabilities.

Do take a look at the code and feel free to use bits and pieces if they fit your need. Remember to thank your sources!

If or when this is finished, and possibly published on the App Store, I do hope you respect my work and effort by not rebranding the application under your own name. This would be a detriment to the open source community and community based learning. Thank you.
